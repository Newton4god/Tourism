<p style="text-align: center; padding: 100px;">There are thousands of zoos around the world, and Nigeria is one of the countries whose zoos contribute to the counting
However, owing to the observation of numerous reports, it saddens one's heart to know that the present state of zoos in Nigeria is nothing to write home about.Total negligence from government and concerned agencies have brought our zoos to a state of pity. With animals not being fed regularly, and workers being underpaid, it easy to understand what I am talking about.Be that as it may, there are still a few number of zoos that can be said to be fair enough if we should compare the to the many others.</p> <br> <br>
